    Your steps will later be converted to SQL commands to transform the Table into the final answer for the question. 
    You MUST thoroughly analyze and understand the Question before writing the plan.

    Plan Steps:
    1. Each step in your plan should be atomic and straightforward, ensuring they can be easily executed or converted into SQL.
    2. You MUST closely examine the Question and ensure all conditions are checked accurately.

    Step Order:
    1. The order of steps is crucial! Ensure the steps logically support the correct answering.
    2. Each step will be executed sequentially, with the next step operating on the output table of the previous step. 
    The first step will be executed on the given Table.

    Final Step:
    Ensure the last step involves selecting the relevant cells or calculating the values that correctly answer the Question.
