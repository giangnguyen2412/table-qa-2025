### Demo Example 1 
Given this Statement: cody zeller helpmin went to washington high school , and his hometown is washington , la

Let verify the statement on this original table table_sql:
/*
col : player | height | school | hometown | college
row 1 : khem birch | 6 - 9 | notre dame prep | montreal , qc , canada | pittsburgh / unlv
row 2 : cody zeller helpmin | 6 - 11 | washington high school | washington , la | los angeles
*/

I executed these below intermediate SQL commands to simplify the table table_sql for you to more easily verify the statement.

SQL1: This SQL query selects the row where the player is cody zeller helpmin and the hometown is washington, la from table table_sql.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_sql
WHERE player = 'cody zeller helpmin' AND hometown = 'washington , la';
```

SQL1 executed on the original table table_sql and results in this table1:
/*
col : player | height | school | hometown | college
row 1 : cody zeller helpmin | 6 - 11 | washington high school | washington , la | los angeles
*/


SQL2: This SQL query selects the player and hometown columns from the table1 table.
```sql
SELECT player, hometown
FROM table1;
```

SQL2 executed on the intermediate table table1 and results in this table2:

/*
col : player | hometown
row 1 : cody zeller helpmin | washington , la
*/


Now, let verify the Statement: cody zeller helpmin went to washington high school , and his hometown is washington , la

Let's think step-by-step and use the table_sql, SQL1, table1, SQL2, and table2 to write the SQL that correctly verifies the statement.
Your SQL must refer to these existing columns only: player or hometown. Otherwise, your SQL will not be executable!
SQL is:
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM table2
            WHERE player = 'cody zeller helpmin' AND hometown = 'washington , la'
        ) THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END AS verification_result;
```

### Demo Example 2
Given this Statement: plymouth argyle played the away team derby county after 18 march 1984

Let verify the statement on this original table table_sql:
/*
col : tie_no | home_team | score | away_team | date
row 1 : 1 | notts county | 1 - 2 | everton | 1984-03-10
row 2 : 3 | plymouth argyle | 0 - 0 | derby county | 1984-03-10
row 3 : replay | derby county | 0 - 1 | plymouth argyle | 1984-03-18
*/

I executed these below intermediate SQL commands to simplify the table table_sql for you to more easily verify the statement.

SQL1: This SQL query selects the rows where plymouth argyle played against derby county as the away team after march 18, 1984 from table table_sql.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_sql
WHERE home_team = 'plymouth argyle' AND away_team = 'derby county' AND date > '1984-03-18';
```

SQL1 executed on the original table table_sql and results in this table1:
/*
col : tie_no | home_team | score | away_team | date
*/

Now, let verify the Statement: plymouth argyle played the away team derby county after 18 march 1984

Let's think step-by-step and use the table_sql, SQL1, and table1 to write the SQL that correctly verifies the statement.
Your SQL must refer to these existing columns only: tie_no or home_team or score or away_team or date. Otherwise, your SQL will not be executable!
SQL is:
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM table1
            WHERE home_team = 'plymouth argyle' AND away_team = 'derby county' AND date > '1984-03-18' 
        ) THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END AS verification_result;
```

# Demo Example 3
Given this Statement: there was a 150 point difference between the highest score and the lowest score

Let verify the statement on this original table table_sql:
/*
col : rank | name | nation | sp_+_fs | points | places
row 1 : 1 | linda fratianne | united states | 1 | 300 | 11
row 2 : 2 | anett p√∂tzsch | east germany | 3 | 184.36 | 18
row 3 : 3 | gloria mas | spain | 3 | 150 | 279
*/

I executed these below intermediate SQL commands to simplify the table_sql table for you to more easily verify the statement.

SQL1: This SQL query calculates the difference between the highest and lowest scores in the points column and creates a new column point_difference.
```sql
SELECT MAX(points) - MIN(points) AS point_difference
FROM table_sql;
```

SQL1 executed on the original table table_sql and results in this table1:
/*
col : point_difference
row 1 : 150
*/

Now, let verify the Statement: there was a 150 point difference between the highest score and the lowest score

Let's think step-by-step and use table_sql, table1, and SQL1 to write the SQL that correctly verifies the statement.
Your SQL must refer to this existing column only: point_difference. Otherwise, your SQL will not be executable!
SQL is:
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM table1 WHERE point_difference = 150
        ) THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END AS verification_result;
```

# Demo Example 4
Given this Statement: iran is the 1st in gdp in the middle east and also ranks tenth among all countries in asia

Let verify the statement on this original table table_sql:
/*
col : rank_mideast | rank_asia | rank_world | country | 2011_gdp_(ppp)_billions_of_usd
row 1 : 1 | 8 | 17 | iran | 930.236
row 2 : 2 | 9 | 23 | saudi arabia | 677.663
row 3 : 3 | 18 | 48 | united arab emirates | 261.189
*/

I executed these below intermediate SQL commands to simplify the table table_sql for you to more easily verify the statement.

SQL1: This SQL query selects the country, rank_mideast, and rank_asia columns from the table table_sql.
```sql
SELECT country, rank_mideast, rank_asia
FROM table_sql
```

SQL1 executed on the original table table_sql and results in this table1:
/*
col : country | rank_mideast | rank_asia
row 1 : iran | 1 | 8
row 2 : saudi arabia | 2 | 9
row 3 : united arab emirates | 3 | 18
*/

SQL2: This SQL query selects the country and its rank in asia where the rank in the middle east is 1.
```sql
SELECT country, rank_asia
FROM table1
WHERE rank_mideast = 1;
```

SQL2 executed on the intermediate table table1 and results in this table2:
/*
col : country | rank_asia
row 1 : iran | 8
*/

Now, let verify the Statement: iran is the 1st in gdp in the middle east and also ranks tenth among all countries in asia

Let's think step-by-step and use the table_sql, SQL1, table1, SQL2, and table2 to write the SQL that correctly verifies the statement.
Your SQL must refer to these existing columns only: country or rank_asia. Otherwise, your SQL will not be executable!
