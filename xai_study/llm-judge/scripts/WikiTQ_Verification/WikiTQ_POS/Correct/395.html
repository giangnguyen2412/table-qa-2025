<td>a green anteater-like experiment with a small body, mouth, arms and legs, a thin tail with a brushy fuzz at the end, a vacuum-like trunk that can fire lasers, dark eyes, short ears, and three dark-tipped spines. designed to sterilize, disinfect, and clean everything in sight. however, he had a problem with doing these tasks: he threw anything away, assuming it was trash, and tried to "sterilize" anyone, assuming they were germs. 010 was upgraded to try to be less of a neat-freak. instead, he turned into a dirt-maker, so lilo gave him to gantu. gantu sent 010 to hämsterviel, who didn't like him and sent him back. gantu set him free, and lilo and stitch found him. later, after he was upgraded, they sent him back to gantu, who sent him back to hämsterviel, who sent him back to gantu when woops almost broke his cover. felix was rescued later in "snafu." the only thing that 010 can say with both of his upgrades is dirty but with felix he says it disgustedly while with oscar he says it happily. both of 010's names are a reference to the main characters of the odd couple. he is voiced by tress macneille in the tv series, while he is voiced by steven blum in the anime's dubbed version.</td>
